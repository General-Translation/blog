If you've ever tried to internationalize an app, you know it can be a pain.
Traditionally, there are several steps in the process:

1. **Library integration**

- The first step is to integrate an internationalization (i18n) library into your app. Often times, this is something like `react-i18next` or `next-i18next`.
- These libraries create source files that contain all of the text you want to translate.

2. **Translation**

- The next step is to upload the source files onto a translation provider and wait for the translations to be completed.
- This also includes communicating with translators to ensure translations contain **context**, are **consistent**, and reflect the app's **global tone**.

3. **Quality Assurance**

- After saving the completed translations, you have to verify that the UI for your app is rendered correctly with the new translations.
- For example, if the German word for "Performance" is **"Leistungsfähigkeit"**, your app's UI should not **cut off**, **break lines**, or **awkwardly** render the word "Leistungsfähigkeit" in the UI.
  - This is a real problem for mobile apps!
- This could involve multiple rounds of iteration and translation.

**All in all, this process has several pain points and bottlenecks:**

- Engineers have to take on painful refactors to integrate the i18n library into their code
- Translations take a **long time** to complete
- Quality of translations is hard to control, and multiple iterations may be needed

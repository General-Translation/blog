## Intro

The other day, I came across a Next.js AI chatbot template on [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot).
To my surprise, it was only available in English.

So I internationalized it. **In 5 minutes.** Here's how:

## Why internationalize?

Often times, developers are so focused on building the product that they forget about the users.
For apps such as AI chatbots which are inherently multilingual and designed to be used by anyone,
what good is a chatbot that only supports English?

If you're working on a startup and your product is only available in English,
aren't you missing out on a lot of potential customers?

Turns out, there's a reason why most products are only available in English. It's because **internationalization is hard**.

Existing libraries such as `next-intl` or `next-i18next` are a pain to setup and use. Not only that, but they don't even do any translations.
You still have to hire translators, manage dictionaries, and deal with all the other pain points of internationalization.
Even minor changes to text could take hours, up to days to be translated.

**Until now.**

Here at General Translation, we've been working on a new library called [gt-next](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries) that makes it easy to internationalize your app.
It's a one stop shop for all your internationalization needs including translations, routing, and more.

I used `gt-next` to internationalize the AI chatbot in **5 minutes**.

## Installation

I began by forking and cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot.git
```

Then, I installed the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you're also running into dependency conflicts like I was, try using this [branch](https://github.com/General-Translation/ai-chatbot/tree/base).

```bash
git clone -b base https://github.com/General-Translation/ai-chatbot.git
```

Next, I installed the [`gt-next`](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries) and [`gt-next-cli`](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries) packages.

```bash
npm install gt-next gt-next-cli
```

## Configuration

Then, I ran the CLI setup tool and selected "Yes" for every question:

```bash
npx gt-next-cli setup
```

After this, I added a few locales to the `next.config.js` plugin:

```js
export default withGTConfig(nextConfig, {
  defaultLocale: 'en-US',
  locales: ['fr', 'es', 'zh'],
})
```

I could've added more locales, but I just wanted to test the chatbot with a few different languages. Feel free to add as many locales as you want!

## Running the chatbot

Of course, I couldn't forget to include all of the environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

After populating all of the required environment variables, including `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` which allows for in-development translation, I ran the chatbot:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That was it! I switched my browser language to French and the UI changed to French. Same for Spanish and Chinese.

Simple, right?

I made it even easier to switch languages by adding a language selector to the header of the chatbot.

```jsx
import { LocaleSelector } from 'gt-next/client';
export default function PureChatHeader() {
  return (
    {/* ... existing code ... */}
    <LocaleSelector />
    {/* ... existing code ... */}
  );
}
```

All I did was import the `LocaleSelector` component and add it to the `chat-header.tsx` component.

It just worked.

## Cleaning up

There were a few things left to clean up, primarily strings.

The CLI setup tool did a good job of translating all of the React elements, but there were a few pesky strings that were hardcoded.

For example, the `model-selector.tsx` file had some hardcoded descriptions of chat models:

```tsx
{
  id: 'chat-model-large',
  name: 'Large model',
  description: 'Large model for complex, multi-step tasks',
},
```

I cleaned these up by importing the `useGT` hook from `gt-next/client` and using it to translate the strings:

```tsx
import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client';
const t = useGT();
{
  id: 'chat-model-large',
  name: t('Large model'),
  description: t('Large model for complex, multi-step tasks'),
},
```

That was it! All of the text in the chatbot was now internationalized and available in any language.

## Deploying to Production

Deploying to production was even easier. I swapped out my `GT_API_KEY` environment variable with my production API key and ran the translate command:

```bash
npx gt-next-cli translate
```

Finally, I deployed the chatbot to Vercel.

## Conclusion

The experience of internationalizing the chatbot was a breeze.
I didn't have to mess around with any configuration files, dictionaries, or fancy routing.

In a matter of minutes, I had a fully functioning,
internationalized AI chatbot that was available in Spanish, French, and Chinese.

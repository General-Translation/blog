Internationalizating of a Next.js app has plenty of pain points. 
For me, the worst parts of i18n are:

- Refactoring my whole codebase to extract strings. It takes a long time!
- Ongoing tech debt from managing translation keys.
- Poor quality, out-of-context machine translations.
- Translations breaking the UI.

If you're a solo developer or working in a small team,
you have to do all of this work manually. 
It wastes a lot of engineering time.

My new open source library, gt-next, fixes **all of these problems**.

## What is gt-next?

gt-next is a Next.js library that makes it easy to internationalize your app.
The key features are:

- Easily internationalize your app, without a big refactor
- See your translations hot reload in development
- Support as many languages as you need, loading them from a global CDN to reduce the bundle size

gt-next integrates with the [generaltranslation.com](generaltranslation.com) platform to:

- Translate content with the latest LLMs
- Manage your translations with an interactive editor
- See translations on demand with development API keys

The goal is a powerful and flexible one stop i18n solution that works for all React and Next.js apps.

Here's what makes gt-next unique:

## Extremely easy to set up

_Goodbye, painful refactors!_

Unlike traditional i18n libraries, gt-next does everything inline.

With legacy i18n libraries, your code might look something like this:

```tsx
// --- UI Code --- //
const t = useTranslations();
return (
  <p>
    {t('membership', { 
      memberSince: user.memberSince 
    })}
  </p>
)
// --- Separate Dictionary File --- //
{
  "membership": "Member since {memberSince, date, short}",
}
```

If you have a large app with thousands of translation entries, this is a **nightmare** to setup, maintain, and modify.

With gt-next, you can just code, without having to worry about separate dictionary items:

```tsx
// --- UI Code --- //
return (
  <T>
    <p>
      Member since <DateTime>{user.memberSince}</DateTime>
    </p>
  </T>
)
```

import and use the `<T>` component and all the translations happen inline.
So no more managing dictionary files,
and you can see content in the context in which it's displayed!

## Real-time translations in development

During development, the library lets you translate your app **on-demand**, so you can see what your changes would look like in other languages.
Just change text in your UI and watch the translation update **in real time**.

This makes quality assurance and editing translations a breeze.

## Context-aware translations

You can add an optional `context` prop to your `<T>` translation components.

This provides additional instructions to the GT translation service.

For example, if you want to specify that a translation should have a certain tone, you can add:

```tsx
<T context={'Translate informally'}>
  <p>Hey there, world!</p>
</T>
```

## Fast and reliable infrastructure

GT services are built for reliability and scalability, ensuring that the translation service is always available.

GT also includes a global CDN, letting the library lazy load translations from the closest edge location.
gt-next also lets you load files locally, or use your own CDN, or a mix of both!

Not only does this drastically reduce the latency of translations and minimize your app's bundle size,
but it also lets you modify your translations in production **without having to re-deploy your app**.

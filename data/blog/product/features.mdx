If you've ever tried to internationalize an app, you've probably experienced some frustrations.
Here are some of the pain points and bottlenecks with traditional internationalization (i18n) libraries:

- You have to spend time refactoring your code to integrate the i18n library
- Managing translation entry keys is a continuous source of tech debt
- Translations take a **long time** to complete
- Quality of translations is hard to control, and multiple iterations could be needed
  - Some translations may be missing context, or may break the UI

What's worse is that if you're a solo developer or working in a small team,
you have to do all of this work manually, thus wasting valuable engineering time.

`gt-next` and `gt-react` fix **all of these problems**.

## What are gt-next and gt-react?

`gt-next` and `gt-react` are two JavaScript libraries that make it easy to internationalize your app.

They allow you to:

- Easily internationalize your app with `T` components
- Not worry about managing translation entry keys
- Translate your app in real-time
- Ship with the confidence that your translations are accurate
- Lazy load translations from a global CDN

They interface with General Translation infrastructure that comprises of:

- A translation engine that is powered by the latest state of the art LLMs and is constantly evolving
- A platform that allows you to manage your translations
- A global CDN that is always available

Combining `gt-next` and `gt-react` with General Translation, you get a powerful and flexible one stop i18n solution.

Here's what makes `gt-next` and `gt-react` unique:

## No Hassle Setup

General Translation is **extremely easy to set up**.

Unlike traditional i18n libraries, General Translation integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase.

_Goodbye, painful refactors!_

With other i18n libraries, your code might look something like this:

```tsx
// --- UI Code --- //
const t = useTranslations();
return (
  <p>{t('membership', { memberSince: user.memberSince })}</p>
)
// --- Separate Dictionary File --- //
{
  "membership": "Member since {memberSince, date, short}",
}
```

In a large app with thousands of translation entries, this is a **nightmare** to setup, maintain, and modify.

With General Translation, you can just code, without having to worry about separate dictionary items:

```tsx
// --- UI Code --- //
return (
  <T>
    <p>
      Member since <DateTime>{user.memberSince}</DateTime>
    </p>
  </T>
)
```

You can also translate strings in-line:

```tsx
// --- UI Code --- //
const t = useGT()
t('Hello, World!')
```

_One less source of tech debt!_

## Real-Time Translation

Powered by the latest state of the art LLMs, the GT translation engine can translate your app **on-demand** and **in real time**.

This means that your app is translated **alongside** your development process.

Translations are so fast that you can even change text in your UI and watch the translation update **in real time**.

This makes quality assurance and editing translations a breeze, and allows you to catch issues early.
If a sentence is too long, just shorten it to see the new updated translation.

## Context-Aware Translations

All translations are done within the context of the code, so you can be confident that the translations are accurate.

Optionally, you can add context to your translations to provide additional information or instructions to the GT translation engine.

For example, you may want to specify that a translation should have a certain tone:

```tsx
<T context={'A friendly and warm greeting'}>
  <p>Hello, World!</p>
</T>
```

## Reliable Infrastructure

General Translation is built on top of a reliable and scalable infrastructure, ensuring that the translation service is always available.

Additionally, the GT Translation Engine is powered by the latest state of the art LLMs, and we are always working to improve it.

## Lazy Loading

General Translation includes a global CDN, allowing translations to be lazy loaded and served from the closest edge location.
This is natively built into the GT libraries, so you don't need to worry about it!
Optionally, `gt-next` and `gt-react` also allow you to use your own CDN.

Not only does this drastically reduce the latency of translations and minimize your app's bundle size,
but it also allows you to modify your translations in production **without having to re-deploy your app**.
